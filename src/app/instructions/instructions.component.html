            When you start, a writing box will appear and the timer will start
            counting down. You can’t pause the timer.

          <li>
            We’ll give you the first sentence to light the spark & you’ll take
            it from there.
          </li>
          <li>
            A few more sentences will appear down the road to force a plot twist
            on you. Maybe.

            You can’t delete the props; their job is to make you think
            fast—don’t overthink it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The timer will warn you near the end to avoid cutting you off
            mid-thought.
